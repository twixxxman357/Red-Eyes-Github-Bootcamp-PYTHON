# RED EYES GITHUB BOOTCAMP

**RED EYES GitHub Bootcamp** is a Python-based desktop application that teaches Git and GitHub using real-world, scenario-based learning instead of command memorization.

This project was built entirely by me as an educational lab and portfolio project.

---

## 📘 About the Project

Many developers struggle with Git not because they don’t know the commands, but because they don’t understand **when and why** to use them.  
This project focuses on how Git is actually used in professional software development teams.

Learners are placed into realistic situations such as:
- Working on features in parallel
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Submitting pull requests
- Collaborating with GitHub remotes
- Following safe, professional workflows

Each question represents a real decision a developer must make.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- 4 learning modules  
- 25 questions per module (100 total questions)  
- No repeated questions across modules  
- Scenario-based explanations after incorrect answers  
- Final exam unlocked after completing all modules
