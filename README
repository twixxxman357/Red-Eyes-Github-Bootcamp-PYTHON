  ## 📘 Project Overview
  
  **RED EYES GitHub Bootcamp** is a scenario-based **desktop learning application** designed to teach **Git and GitHub workflows** the way they are actually used in professional software development environments.
  
  Rather than focusing on memorization of commands, this project emphasizes **decision-making**, **workflow safety**, and **real-world collaboration scenarios**. Learners are placed into situations they would encounter on real teams and are guided through best practices using immediate feedback and explanations.
  
  This project was **designed and built entirely by me**, from the curriculum and questions to the Python application and user interface.

  ## 🎯 What This Project Is About
  
  This project exists to answer a simple question:
  
  > *How do developers really use Git and GitHub on teams?*
  
  The lab teaches:
  - When to branch (and why)
  - How pull requests protect production
  - How to handle merge conflicts safely
  - Why rebasing and force-pushing can be dangerous
  - How CI/CD fits into modern workflows
  - How teams collaborate without breaking each other’s work
  
  Every question represents a **real decision** a developer must make.

  ## 🧠 Learning Approach
  
  - 100 total questions
  - 4 structured learning modules
  - No repeated questions across modules
  - 50+ real-world scenario-based questions
  - Scenario-based explanations after incorrect answers
  - Final exam unlocked after completing all modules
  
  Mistakes are treated as **learning moments**, not failures.
